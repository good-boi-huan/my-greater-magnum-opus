# Loops

# Boolean operators
# Comparision operators
# < (less than)
# > (greater than)
# <= (less than or equal to)
# >= (greater than or equal to)
# == (equal to)
# != (not equal to)
# Let x = 3
# x < 5 (less than) true
# x > 5 (greater than) false
# Let x = 5
# x <= 5 (less than or equal to) true
# x >= 5 (greater than or equal to) true
# x == 5 (equal to) true
# x != 5 (not equal to) false

# Logical operators
# let x = 5 and y = 6
# and if x = 5 and if y = 5 false
# or if x = 5 or if y = 5 true, if x = 6 or if y = 5 false
# not if x is not 5 false, if x is not 4 true

# While loop
# initializing
# counter = 0
# # While loop takes in a boolean expression (T/F)\
# # A while loop will only run if the boolean expression is true

# while(counter < 5):
#   print(counter + 1)
#   counter = counter + 1
